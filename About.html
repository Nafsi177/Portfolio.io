                    I'm Jannatul Feardous Nafsi.
I am a Student of Daffodil International University in the department of computer science and engineering. I was born on 17 December in 2000 and brought up in a middle-class Muslim family at Dhaka, Bangladesh. Being the youngest member of my family, I enjoyed every opportunity to be spoiled by the unconditional love of my parents and siblings. Taking full advantage of those love around me, I turned out as a passionate young woman. I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life.
I'm skilled at 3 different programming language C, Java, Python I'm also skilled at different Microsoft tools Word, Excel & PowerPoint etc. Now I'm currently learning Graphic Designing & UI/UX designing. In future I want to see myself as a software developer & Creative Designer.
